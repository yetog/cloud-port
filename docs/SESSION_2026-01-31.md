| App.tsx | Theme/Sound/Sidebar providers |

**New components added:**
- `src/components/rpg/` - FF7Panel, AttributeBar, MateriaIndicator, etc.
- `src/contexts/` - ThemeContext, SoundContext, SidebarContext
- `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- `src/components/SoundToggle.tsx`

### 3. Music Page Routing Fixed

- Added `try_files` for SPA routing
- Music page now accessible at `/music`

### 4. Apps Page Redesigned
- Added List/Grid view toggle (defaults to List)
- Compact list rows with status dots
- Compact grid cards
- Testing/Upgrading collapsed by default
- RPG styling (FF7Panel header)
- Removed emojis from all 21 app titles

### 5. Credentials Saved

## Remaining Tasks for Next Session

### High Priority

1. **Set up remaining testing apps**
   - `bh-ai-79` - IONOS creds saved, needs backend config
   - `zen-tot` - Needs credentials from owner
   - `purple-lotus` - Expo app, special handling needed

2. **Music page streaming architecture**
   - Owner will upload tracks to S3 in free time
   - Update `src/data/music.ts` with track URLs
   - Enhance player with actual audio playback

3. **Add Gamma credentials to server**
   - Owner mentioned wanting to add these

### Medium Priority

4. **Review duplicate apps**
   - ContentForge and SpriteGen - may only need one

5. **Fix voice-assistant (unhealthy)**
   - Container shows unhealthy status

6. **Add custom app images**
   - Testing/upgrading apps use placeholder images

### Low Priority

7. **Configure GitHub Actions secrets**
   - SERVER_HOST, SERVER_USER, SERVER_SSH_KEY

8. **Portfolio content updates**
   - Cloud Infrastructure projects
   - Art Curation entries
   - Audio Engineering projects

npm run build

./scripts/deploy-testing-apps.sh [app-name]

# Check nginx config
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
