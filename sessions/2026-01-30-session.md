## Insights & Patterns

### What Worked Well
- Parallel file operations saved time
- Category system with collapsible sections is clean UX
- Music player fixed to bottom works like Spotify
- Session context script provides good visibility

### Challenges Solved
- SSH key was on wrong repo → changed remote to cloud-port
- Deploy key vs account key confusion → generated new key
- Needed force push after remote change

### Architecture Decisions
- Apps have `status: 'finished' | 'testing' | 'upgrading'`
- Separate exports for each category + combined `apps` array
- Music player is a separate component, not connected to actual audio yet
- Scripts use color-coded output for readability

---

## Next Steps (Future Sessions)

1. **Content:** Add actual music tracks, art curation, audio projects
2. **Apps:** Serve testing/upgrading apps, add custom images
3. **CI/CD:** Configure GitHub secrets for auto-deploy
4. **Refinement:** Review cloud vs hosting project categories
